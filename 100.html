                        is necessary for the complete identification of the petitioner, it should always be
                        included complete with ZIP Code number. In addition, telephone and facsimile numbers
                        should be provided to expedite handling of the petition. Petitions for access are

                        in an interference, derivation proceeding, or trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal

                        record, or attorney or agent of record in the application to which access is sought, or
                        the petition may be filed in duplicate, in which case the duplicate copy will be sent by
                        the Office to the inventor, applicant in an application filed on or after September 16,
                        2012, assignee of record, or attorney or agent of record in the application (hereinafter
                        “applicant”). A separate petition, with fee, must be filed for each application file to
                        which access is desired. Each petition should show not only why access is desired, but
                        also why petitioner believes he or she is entitled to access. The applicant will
                        normally be given a limited period such as 3 weeks within which to state any objection
                        to the granting of the petition for access and reasons why it should be denied. If
                        applicant states that he or she has no objection to the requested access, the petition
                        will be granted. If objection is raised or applicant does not respond, the petition will
                        be decided on the record. If access is granted to the application, any objections filed
                        by the applicant will be available to the petitioner since these papers are in the
                        application file. If access to the application is denied, petitioner will not receive
                        copies of any objections filed by the applicant. A determination will be made whether
                        “special circumstances” are present which warrant a grant of access under

                        application is incorporated by reference in a United States patent. “Special
                        circumstances” could be found where an applicant has relied upon his or her application
                        as a means to interfere with a competitor’s business or customers. See, e.g.,
                        <i>In re Crossman, </i>187 USPQ 367 (PTO Solicitor 1975); and <i>
                           In re Trimless Cabinets,</i> 128 USPQ 95 (Comm’r Pat. 1960). Furthermore,
                        “special circumstances” could be found where an attorney or agent of record in an
                        application in which a provisional double patenting rejection is made does not have
                        power of attorney in the copending application having a common assignee or inventor.
                        However, a more expeditious means of obtaining access would be to obtain power to
                        inspect from an assignee or inventor. See <href="s104.html#d0e2475">MPEP §§ 104</a></b> and <href="s106.html#d0e2719">106.01</a></b>.

                              Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each
                              record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject
                              matter of the record, and the name and location of the office where the record
                              is located. Also, if records about a court case are sought, the title of the
                              case, the court in which the case was filed, and the nature of the case should
                              be included. If known, any file designations or descriptions for the requested
                              records should be included. In general, the more specifically the request
                              describes the records sought, the greater the likelihood that USPTO will locate
                              those records. If the FOIA Officer determines that a request does not
                              reasonably describe records, the FOIA Officer will inform the requester what
                              additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient.
                              The FOIA Officer also may give the requester an opportunity to discuss the
                              request so that it may be modified to meet the requirements of this
                              section.

                           (Type I secrecy order)— to be used for those patent applications that disclose
                           critical technology with military or space application in accordance with DoD
                           Directive 5230.25 “Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data From Public
                           Disclosure,” based on 10 U.S.C. 130 “Authority to Withhold From Public Disclosure
                           Certain Technical Data.”

                           (Type II secrecy order)— to be used for those patent applications which contain
                           data that is properly classified or classifiable under a security guideline where
                           the patent application owner has a current DoD Security Agreement, DD Form 441. If
                           the application is classifiable, this secrecy order allows disclosure of the
                           technical information as if it were classified as prescribed in the National
                           Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).

                           those patent applications that contain data deemed detrimental to national
                           security if published or disclosed, including that data properly classifiable
                           under a security guideline where the patent application owner does not have a DoD
                           Security Agreement. The order prevents disclosure of the subject matter to anyone
                           without an express written consent from the Commissioner for Patents. However,
                           quite often this type of secrecy order includes a permit “Permit A” which relaxes
                           the disclosure restrictions as set forth in the permit.

                        disclosure which would result in an unlawful exportation. This type of Secrecy Order
                        also identifies the countries where corresponding patent applications may be filed.
                        Countries with which the United States has reciprocal security agreements are:
                        Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg,

                        directly with the European Patent Office since no reciprocal security agreement with
                        this organization exists. Applications must be filed in the individual EPO member
                        countries identified above. Applicant must arrange filing of such subject matter through
                        the agency sponsoring the secrecy order.

                        other classified material. Accordingly, this Secrecy Order will include a notification
                        of the classification level of the technical data in the application.

                        publication of the invention in any form. Furthermore, other patent applications already
                        filed or later filed which contain any significant part of the subject matter of the
                        application also fall within the scope of the Order and must be brought to the attention
                        of Licensing &amp; Review if such applications are not already under Secrecy Order by
                        the Commissioner.

                        except as permitted by the Secrecy Order. The law also requires that all information

                        ensure a proper security clearance. Personnel controlling the cleared correspondence

                        even ensured. If the application is not marked by the security screeners, the petition is
                        granted. The filing receipt or other official notice will indicate if a foreign filing
                        license is granted. The license becomes effective on the date shown. Further,&nbsp;grant of this
                        license is made of record in the application file. The scope of this license is quite broad
